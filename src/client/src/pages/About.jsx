        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Taste Trivia was born from a shared love for food and a desire to
          create a fun and engaging way for people to test their culinary
          knowledge. We believe that food is more than just sustenanceâ€”it's a
          way to connect with different cultures, explore new flavors, and
          challenge ourselves. Whether you're a seasoned chef or a curious
          foodie, our app offers a unique way to learn, play, and connect with a
          community of like-minded individuals.
