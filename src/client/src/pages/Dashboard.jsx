// This Dashboard component serves as a placeholder for the user's dashboard or leaderboard.
// It displays the logged-in user's name or email and provides a link back to the home page.
// The component uses the `useAuth` hook to access the current user state and the logout function.
// The dashboard can be expanded in the future to include user-specific content, such as quiz results or leaderboards.
// The logout button allows users to log out of their account, clearing their session.
